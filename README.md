# How to use
Once "start" is clicked in Visual Studio, it will present you with a menu-driven interface that allows you to choose multiple desired actions. It also allows you to exit the program if/when needed cleanly.
# Known bugs or problems
There are no known bugs or problems. Next time I will begin this project earlier to allow more thorough testing and implement features that make the user interface more friendly to view.
# Top things I've learned
1. How to access and manipulate specific object elements in a list in C#.
2. Avoiding bad programming practices like "while(true)", as well as "breaks".
3. How to use C# inheritance to allow children classes to access the private data member variables of its parent class.
